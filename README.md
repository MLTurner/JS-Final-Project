# JS-Final-Project
Milestone project after covering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, User Interface Design and User Experience.

This is a classic game of Rock, Paper Scissors: Rock beats Scissors, Paper beats Rock, Scissors beats Paper. It is a one-player game of user versus computer. I drew inspiration from the theme of "rock" in Rock, Paper, Scissors, and obtained a photo of Stonehenge during a sunset. The colors of the game interface are meant to be calming and most are taken directly from the sunset background using the color dropper from the dev tools.
